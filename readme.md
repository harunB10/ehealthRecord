The „eHealth Record System“ is an information system which as its primary goal has to provide health institutions easier and better work - time organization. The information system is divided into three user sectors (patient, doctor, medical staff) where each user sector has a separate authorization and access to information. A key factor in the information system is that each user, in the extent of its authorities, has access to information 24 hours a day with any device that has access to internet connection.

Key features:
- Patients can apply for medical examination
- Doctors can organize patient's requests and store them into calendar (agenda)
- Doctors can view patient's history of illness
- Doctors can send the patient to medical staff
- Doctors can insert diagnosis and prescribe therapy
- Medical staff can insert blood analysis data into patient's health record
